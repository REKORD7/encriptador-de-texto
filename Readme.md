# Oracle Next Education G6 Challenge 1: Encryptor/Decryptor

This project consists of the creation of an encryptor and decryptor using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Encryption Keys
In this challenge, we will use the following encryption keys:
+ "e" converts to "enter"
+ "i" converts to "imes"
+ "a" converts to "ai"
+ "o" converts to "ober"
+ "u" converts to "ufat"

## Requirements
+ The application should work only with lowercase letters.
+ Do not use letters with accents or special characters.
+ It should be possible to convert a word to its encrypted version and vice versa.

## Examples:
+ "gato" => "gaitober"
+ "gaitober" => "gato"
